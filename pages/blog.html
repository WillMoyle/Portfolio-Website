            <h2 class="blog_title">Movie Marketing - Spoiler Alert</h2>
            <h3 class="blog_date">Dec 9, 2015</h3>
            <p>This is the story of the greatest plot twist in cinema history.
            <p>Our tale starts in 1984 with a small sci-fi horror film, from a relatively unknown filmmaker. With a budget of just $8.4 million dollars and a lead actor with such little mastery of the English language that he was dubbed over in his previous film (hence only being given 14 lines to say in this movie), no one expected it to be much of a success.</p>
            <p>Then came the tagline:</p>
            <p class="blog_quote">In the Year of Darkness, 2029, the rulers of this planet devised the ultimate plan. They would reshape the Future by changing the Past. The plan required something that felt no pity. No pain. No fear. Something unstoppable.</p>
            <p>The trailer, too, tapped into the zeitgeist of the mid-80's - technophobia was on the rise as the world took its first steps into the digital age, while interest in sci-fi was at an all time high due to the imminent release of the final (well, back then it was) Star Wars movie.</p>
            <div class="blog_media">
                <iframe width="420" height="300" align="middle" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHz95RYUbik" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="blog_caption">The amazing hair also added to the appeal (and still does)</p>
            <p>The film was, of course, <em>The Terminator</em>. Strong box office and even stronger home video (still in its infancy) sales created a smash hit. It earned over 12 times its budget and made household names out of director James Cameron (who would go on to make two of the highest grossing films of all time) and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger (who became among the highest-paid actors of all time and, of course, Governor of California).</p>
            <p>However, I promised that this was a story about the world's greatest plot twist and, for that, we need to wait 7 years for the sequel, <em>Terminator 2: Judgment</em> (not Judgement) <em>Day</em>.</p>
            <p>In the original, Arnold Schwarzenegger played one of the most terrifying screen villains of all time - a cold, ruthless killing machine, sent from the future, that will stop at nothing until it completes its murderous mission. The handsome soldier, Kyle Reese (played by Michael Biehn), was sent back in time to protect the key to humanity's survival, Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor.</p>
            <p>The sequel began in a very similar vein as its predecessor. The sinister Terminator and an apparently-human soldier, played by Robert Patrick, arrive from the future and start tracking down Sarah's son, John Connor. Many of the plot beats are the same in the opening act and the audience is captured by the already-palpable tension - clearly we're in for another two hours of terror and hiding behind the sheets.</p>
            <p>Then comes the twist, as Patrick and a shotgun-toting Schwarzenegger both bear down on John, the Terminator fires into our 'hero' protector, who then rises from the ground revealing his true nature with spectacular shape-shifting visual effects. Arnie is there to protect John, while Patrick plays the menacing, liquid-metal T-1000. Not only was this twist unlike anything that came before it, it also heralded a shift in the film's tone - no longer horror, Terminator 2 is one of the greatest action films of all time.</p>
            <div class="blog_media">

            </div>
            <p>How incredible it must have been to be in the movie's initial screenings - with all your expectations and preconceptions subverted!</p>
            <p>Unless, of course, you happened to have been one of the millions to have seen the film's trailer:</p>
            <div class="blog_media">
                <iframe width="420" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eajuMYNYtuY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>The words <em>"once he was programmed to destroy the future, now his mission is to protect it"</em> might have given the audience a hint as to what's to come - significantly reducing, in my opinion, their enjoyment of the movie.</p>
            <p>I can only think of a few industries in which marketing plays such a great role and yet the more of it there is, the worse the consumer's enjoyment of the product will be.</p>
            <p>Take, for instance, the trailer for <em>Rocky</em>, which manages to essentially tell the entire story, including the ending.</p>
            <div class="blog_media">
                <iframe width="420" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7RYpJAUMo2M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="blog_caption">Trailer is maybe the wrong word - maybe 'summary'</p>
            <p>At least the Terminator franchise leaned its lesson and began producing subtle, plot-light trailers that capture the essence of a film and raise excitement, without ruining expectations. It's not as though they gave away the movie's twists...</p>
            <div class="blog_media">
                <iframe width="420" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GmLfivKQL8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="blog_caption">Sam Worthington's robotic acting was deliberate (for this film at least)</p>
            <p>Twice more...</p>
            <div class="blog_media">
                <iframe width="420" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGSxss7gWak" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="blog_caption">It takes a lot to make a plot twist more dumb than that title</p>
            <p>I may be picking on the Terminator Franchise too much. After all, the trailer for 2012's <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8PVqw2jfrI">The Avengers</a></em> contains the final action shot of the movie, while, that same year, the marketing team for <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em> released a grand total of <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/watch-25minute-cut-the-amazing-spiderman-courtesy-sonys-marketing-materials/">25 minutes</a> of footage in various trailers and clips. Perhaps most infamously, the trailer for <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJvosb4UCLs">Cast Away</a></em> shows Tom Hanks reuniting with Helen Hunt after getting off that island!</p>
            <p>With movie studios spending approximately the same amount on marketing a movie as they do on filming it, is it any wonder that trailers are releasing key twists and action moments to entice the paying public? After all, the filmmakers themselves have relatively little power over what the marketing team release (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/01/terminator-genisys-director-had-unpleasant-talks-over-trailer-spoilers">as seen with director Alan Taylor's anger at the Terminator Genisys trailer</a>).</p>
            <p>In this era of multi-billion dollar franchises, in which sequels are green-lit before the original is even released (not a smart move, <em><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-11/24/fantastic-four-sequel-cancelled">Fantastic Four</a></em>), getting bums on seats has never been more vital. We live in a world in which we are endlessly bombarded with movie trailers and posters (try <strong>not</strong> watching a Star Wars trailer at the moment - trust me, it's not possible). Even though they risk spoiling the very product that they are trying to sell us, studios will do everything they can to get us into theatres (where we can also bankrupt ourselves at the concessions stand - $8 for a tiny bottle of water New York, seriously!?).</p>
            <p>Sadly this strategy works, and until the audience starts voting with its feet and seeking out films that offer an element of mystery and intrigue (such as the work of Christopher Nolan), nothing will change. If only Terminator 2 had given audiences a bit of credit, the greatest plot revelation in cinema history would be remembered as such.</p>
            <p>... Although maybe the best plot twist ever actually involves Darth Vader's relationship with Luke Skywalker - what do I know?</p>

            <h3 class="blog_date">Dec 5, 2015</h3>
            <p><strong>The house always wins.</strong></p>
            <p>That's the first rule of gambling. It's the reason why one casino in Las Vegas made over half a billion dollars of profit in 2014 and why I have historically steered clear of the roulette table. However, is this always the case?</p>
            <div class="blog_media">
                <img src="../img/blackjack/roulette.jpg"/>
            </div>
            <p class="blog_caption">Such lovely smiles... what a fun way to eventually suffer the inevitable wrath of probability</p>
            <p>A couple of weeks ago, I decided to look into my favourite way to lose money, Blackjack. I wrote a program using <strong>Python</strong> (which you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/WillMoyle/Blackjack">GitHub page</a>) that allowed me to automate the game and run a set number of simple strategies many times to analyse which (if any) would give me the <strong>best chance of leaving a casino with cash still in my pocket</strong>.</p>
            <p>I'm not talking about counting cards in this case. Not many people can do that (I certainly can't) and it'll get you kicked out of the casino pretty quickly. It does make for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095953/">good</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478087/">movies</a>, though. For the sake of this project, I was looking for very simple strategies that should, eventually, leave a player with more money than they started with.</p>
            <p>I'm not going to go into the rules in much detail (you can find a very good description <a href="http://www.pagat.com/banking/blackjack.html">here</a>) but the key points are these:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by holding a hand of cards worth closer to 21 than the dealer but not over</li>
                <li>Aces are worth one or eleven points</li>
                <li>Jacks, Queens and Kings are worth ten points</li>
                <li>All other cards are worth their number (e.g. three of clubs is worth three points)</li>
                <li>Players start with two cards and can either choose to stand (settle for the total value of their hand) or hit (add a new card to their hand)</li>
                <li>If the player's hand is worth 21 initially (with an ace and a card worth ten points) then the player has a 'blackjack' and will typically win back 1.5 times her initial bet</li>
                <li>Once the player has stood or gone bust (i.e. has a hand worth over 21) then the dealer plays</li>
                <li>The dealer is required to play by a given strategy</li>
                <li>Depending on the casino, the dealer must either stand on a <em>Soft 17</em> (i.e. a hand worth 17 points with the ace counting as eleven, designated <em>s17</em>) or only stand when he reaches a <em>Hard 17</em> (i.e. a hand worth 17 points with the ace counting as one, designated <em>h17</em>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The last rule is a bit complicated, but makes a <strong>big</strong> difference (you can find more information <a href="http://www.readybetgo.com/blackjack/strategy/soft-17-rule-2496.html">here</a>).</p>
            <div class="blog_media">
                <img src="../img/blackjack/players.jpg"/>
            </div>
            <p class="blog_caption">Wow, these guys are smiling too, they clearly haven't had to listen to me explain the rules</p>
            <p>There are many variations to the game, but these are the rules that I decided to model. The strategies that I implemented were relatively straight forward: the player hits until he reaches a given limit (from 12 up to 21, depending on the strategy). These, in turn, were modelled for either a hard limit or soft limit.</p>
            <p>For example, given the limit of 15, I modelled four separate scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing a game with <em>s17</em> rules, the player stands when she achieves a 15 including an ace counted as one (i.e. <em>Hard 15</em>, or <em>h15</em>)</li>
                <li>Playing a game with <em>s17</em> rules, the player stands when she achieves a 15 including an ace counted as eleven (i.e. <em>Soft 15</em>, or <em>s15</em>)</li>
                <li>Playing a game with <em>h17</em> rules, the player stands when she achieves a 15 including an ace counted as one (<em>h15</em>)</li>
                <li>Playing a game with <em>h17</em> rules, the player stands when she achieves a 15 including an ace counted as eleven (<em>s15</em>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I simulated a total of <strong>4 million games</strong>, 1 million for each scenario, evenly spread for 10 limits from 12 to 21.</p>
            <p>The <strong>percentage of wins never surpassed 46%</strong>. However, given that winning with a blackjack gives a 1.5 multiplier bonus, there were a few scenarios that meant that the player could leave the casino without being in debt to some nasty people. The formula for overall winnings is:</p>
            <p class="blog_formula">WINNINGS = NUMBER_OF_GAMES * BET_PER_GAME * [PERCENTAGE_WINS - PERCENTAGE_LOSSES + PERCENTAGE_BLACKJACKS * (MULTIPLIER - 1) ]</p>
            <p>The chart below shows expected winnings for the different strategies (after playing 100 games betting $10 per game)</p>
            <div class="blog_media">
                <img src="../img/blackjack/chart.png"/>
            </div>
            <p class="blog_caption">Notice there are a lot of negative numbers there!</p>
            <p>As you can see, after putting <strong>$1000</strong> at risk, the best case scenario has the player expecting to leave with a <strong>grand total of $18</strong>... maybe enough for the cab ride home. Still, this experiment has at least allowed me to conclude the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the dealer must stand on <em>Hard 17</em> (<em>h17</em>), then the best simple strategy is to stand on a <strong>Soft 14</strong></li>
                <li>If the dealer must stand on <em>Soft 17</em> (<em>s17</em>), then you'd be better off leaving the $1000 under the mattress, as you should <strong>expect to lose</strong> (although to minimise your loss, play <em>s15</em>, you'll only lose $12)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I had a lot of fun with this, so I think I'm going to dig a little deeper, perhaps finding the best scenario that takes into account the number of decks being used or the dealer's face up card - so look out for that post in the near future.</p>
            <p>Until then, gamble responsibly... or better yet, not at all - it's probably not worth it.</p>

            <h2 class="blog_title">THE MONTY HALL PROBLEM (OR WHY GAME SHOW CONTESTANTS NEED PROBABILITY LESSONS)</h2>
            <h3 class="blog_date">Nov 25, 2015</h3>
            <p>Nearly every probability course will make some reference to the 'Monty Hall Problem'. This peculiar problem has been around for decades and illustrates the <strong>surprising, and often counter-intuitive, nature of probability</strong>. It's loosely based upon a game show called 'Let's Make a Deal' and named after the show's host.</p>
            <p>The set-up is this: the player is presented with three doors. Behind one door is a prize - let's say, for the sake of argument, it's an Oculus Rift (the door is quite small). Behind the other two doors, there's something less exciting (maybe it's a Nintendo Virtual Boy). The player chooses a door. Without any other information, we can hopefully all agree that the odds of our player being pleased with what's behind the door is <strong>1 in 3</strong> (unless she's a particular fan of terrible 90's VR consoles).</p>
            <p>Here's where things get interesting - the game show host opens one of the other two doors that doesn't hide our grand prize. The player then gets to choose whether to stick with her initial choice, or to open the other closed door. What should she do? The prize is behind one of two doors, so surely the odds are now <strong>50:50</strong> and it makes no difference which door she opens?</p>
            <p>Clearly, by the way I phrased the question, the answer is no. She should always switch! In fact, she would have a <strong>2 in 3</strong> chance of getting the prize if she swaps to the other door.</p>
            <p>I'm not going to get into the intricacies of probability here, there are a number of sources that'll explain things much better than I ever could (in fact there's a whole <a href="http://www.montyhallproblem.com/">website</a> dedicated to it). Our problem gets more complex when you consider a choice between N doors, in which the host opens P doors without the prize [1].</p>
            <p>I was reintroduced to this problem in an excellent book that I'm reading (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Naked-Statistics-Stripping-Dread-Data/dp/1480590185">Naked Statistics, by Charles Wheelan</a>) and it got me thinking about how I could simulate this problem for myself. As is so often the way, this lead to a sleepless night during which I planned out a program in my head that would allow a user to play this game manually themselves and also to run play the game automatically a large number of times, for different numbers of doors, to see if the formulas are correct (hint: they are, they were written by people much smarter than me).</p>
            <p>You can find the program that I wrote on my <a href="https://github.com/WillMoyle/Monty-Hall-Problem">GitHub</a> page, but below are the results of my experiments:</p>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, with 3 doors, the win rate when switching is 67%. As the number of doors increases (assuming the host still only opens one 'wrong' door), the win rate drops, but it's always higher than not switching.</p>
            <div class="blog_media">
                <img src="../img/monty/montychart1.png"/>
            </div>
            <p>Given a set number of doors, in this case 100, the win rate increases as the host opens more doors. If the host opens 98 of the remaining 99 doors, then you have a <strong>99%</strong> chance of winning if you switch.</p>
            <div class="blog_media">
                <img src="../img/monty/montychart2.png"/>
